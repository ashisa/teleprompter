# No external dependencies required - uses built-in tkinter
# This teleprompter application uses only Python standard library modules:
# - tkinter (GUI framework)
# - threading (for auto-scrolling)
# - time (for scroll timing)

# If you need to install tkinter on Linux systems:
# sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# For Windows and macOS, tkinter comes pre-installed with Python
